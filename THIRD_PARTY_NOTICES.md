The GPT, Claude, DeepSeek and Doubao icons are also reused without modification under `games/splendor/web/assets/brands/`, with the same notices and rights exclusions. Pokémon keeps its existing game strategies; these brands are cosmetic identities, not live model opponents.

The collection's card illustration and favicon are original HTML/CSS/SVG assets and use the root MIT license. No Sites account configuration, proprietary deployment credentials, or runtime player data are distributed with this repository.

## Splendor: Pokémon fan implementation

`games/splendor/` is an unofficial implementation of the published Pokémon edition. Pokémon characters, names and trademarks belong to their respective rights holders, including Nintendo, Creatures, GAME FREAK and The Pokémon Company. Splendor belongs to Space Cowboys / Asmodee. No affiliation, endorsement or official license is claimed. The root MIT license does not grant rights to those characters, marks or the physical game artwork.

Numeric card fields were adapted from LeonJoeeee/splendor-pokemon at commit `c4a0a4fe564483d9568a0a436367400a090f9657`. Preserve [its code license and exclusions](games/splendor/licenses/Pokemon-reference.txt), copyright (c) 2026 Leon (LeonJoeeee). Data is a community transcription, not a publisher-certified deck audit.

All 55 local SVG character illustrations come from **The Artificial — Pokémon Icons**, pinned to commit `132142217e40990f694142d9efb28ecde1e2976e`. The creator describes these as fan art made from scratch and expressly permits sharing with attribution under CC-BY (version not specified). Preserve [the original asset README](games/splendor/web/assets/pokemon/README.txt) and the author link to https://theartificial.github.io/pokemon-icons/. SVG contents are unchanged; only display size is controlled by CSS. The old generated atlas and numeric stand-ins are no longer used. Character rights remain excluded from the code MIT license. See [the source and artwork record](games/splendor/SOURCES.md).

## User-supplied human-player portrait

`games/splendor/web/assets/players/human.png` was supplied by the site owner for the human-player avatar. The image bytes are preserved; CSS frames it within avatar controls. The additional selectable human portraits and their mechanically resized WebP thumbnails are also owner-supplied third-party images. All are excluded from the code MIT license.
